  short_name: Cloud IoT Core Device Federated Authentication
  url: https://cloud.google.com/iot/alpha/docs/how-tos/federated_auth
  description: >
    Devices authenticated to Cloud IoT Core can use the `Token Service <https://cloud.google.com/iot/alpha/docs/reference/cloudiottoken/rest>`_ federated authentication to request `OAuth 2.0 access tokens <https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2>`_ in exchange for their `Cloud IoT Core JWTs <https://cloud.google.com/iot/docs/how-tos/credentials/jwts>`_.
    The OAuth 2.0 credentials can be used to call different `Google Cloud APIs <https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2/scopes>`_ with fine-grained permissions and access control using `Workload Identity Federation <https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/workload-identity-federation>`_.
    For more information, see `documentation <https://cloud.google.com/iot/alpha/docs/how-tos/federated_auth>`_.
