    # Google Cloud IoT Core Python Device Federated Authentication example
    This sample app demonstrates the capabilites of Google Cloud IoT Core device federated authentication feature.
    Devices authenticated to Cloud IoT Core can use the [Token Service](https://cloud.google.com/iot/alpha/docs/reference/cloudiottoken/rest) federated authentication to request [OAuth 2.0 access tokens](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2) in exchange for their [Cloud IoT Core JWTs](https://cloud.google.com/iot/docs/how-tos/credentials/jwts).
    The OAuth 2.0 credentials can be used to call different [Google Cloud APIs](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2/scopes) with fine-grained permissions and access control using [Workload Identity Federation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/workload-identity-federation).
