    Cloud IoT Core allows developers to easily integrate Publish and
    Subscribe functionality with devices and programmatically manage device
    authorization.

    This example connects a device to Cloud IoT Core via MQTT, using a JWT for
    authentication. After connecting, the device publishes messages to the device's 
    MQTT topic at a rate of one per second.

    Note that before you can run this sample, you  must register a device as described 
    in the `Cloud IoT device docs <https://cloud.google.com/iot/docs/how-tos/devices>`_. 
    For the gateway samples, you must register and bind a device as described in the 
    `Cloud IoT gateway docs <https://cloud.google.com/iot/docs/how-tos/gateways#setup>`_.
