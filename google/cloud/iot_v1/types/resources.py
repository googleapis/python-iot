            registry.
        name (str):

            When ``name`` is populated as a response from the service,
            it always ends in the device numeric ID.
        num_id (int):
            [Output only] A server-defined unique numeric ID for the
            device. This is a more compact way to identify devices, and
            it is globally unique.
        credentials (Sequence[google.cloud.iot_v1.types.DeviceCredential]):
            The credentials used to authenticate this device. To allow
            credential rotation without interruption, multiple device
            credentials can be bound to this device. No more than 3
            credentials can be bound to a single device at a time. When
            new credentials are added to a device, they are verified

            through MQTT. MQTT clients usually only send ``PINGREQ``
            messages if the connection is idle, and no other messages
            have been sent. Timestamps are periodically collected and
            written to storage; they may be stale by a few minutes.

            only for configurations sent through MQTT.
        last_config_send_time (google.protobuf.timestamp_pb2.Timestamp):
            [Output only] The last time a cloud-to-device config version
            was sent to the device.
        blocked (bool):
            If a device is blocked, connections or
            requests from this device will fail. Can be used
            to temporarily prevent the device from
            connecting if, for example, the sensor is
            generating bad data and needs maintenance.
        last_error_time (google.protobuf.timestamp_pb2.Timestamp):
            [Output only] The time the most recent error occurred, such
            as a failure to publish to Cloud Pub/Sub. This field is the
            timestamp of 'last_error_status'.
        last_error_status (google.rpc.status_pb2.Status):
            [Output only] The error message of the most recent error,
            such as a failure to publish to Cloud Pub/Sub.
            'last_error_time' is the timestamp of this field. If no
            errors have occurred, this field has an empty message and
            the status code 0 == OK. Otherwise, this field is expected
            to have a status code other than OK.
        config (google.cloud.iot_v1.types.DeviceConfig):
            The most recent device configuration, which is eventually
            sent from Cloud IoT Core to the device. If not present on
            creation, the configuration will be initialized with an
            empty payload and version value of ``1``. To update this
            field after creation, use the
            ``DeviceManager.ModifyCloudToDeviceConfig`` method.
        state (google.cloud.iot_v1.types.DeviceState):
            [Output only] The state most recently received from the

            present.
        log_level (google.cloud.iot_v1.types.LogLevel):

            metadata is not interpreted or indexed by Cloud IoT Core. It
            can be used to add contextual information for the device.

            [a-zA-Z][a-zA-Z0-9-_.+~%]+ and be less than 128 bytes in

            Values are free-form strings. Each value must be less than

            The total size of all keys and values must be less than 256
            KB, and the maximum number of key-value pairs is 500.

            telemetry event using MQTT without specifying a

            the connection closes automatically. If you try

            are guaranteed to be stored in the state
            history, but notifications to Cloud Pub/Sub are
            not guaranteed. For example, if permissions are
