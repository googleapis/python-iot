            registry.
        name (str):

            When ``name`` is populated as a response from the service,
            it always ends in the device numeric ID.
        num_id (int):
            [Output only] A server-defined unique numeric ID for the

            The credentials used to authenticate this device. To allow

            through MQTT. MQTT clients usually only send ``PINGREQ``
            messages if the connection is idle, and no other messages

        last_config_send_time (google.protobuf.timestamp_pb2.Timestamp):
            [Output only] The last time a cloud-to-device config version
            was sent to the device.
        blocked (bool):
            If a device is blocked, connections or
            requests from this device will fail. Can be used
            to temporarily prevent the device from
            connecting if, for example, the sensor is
            generating bad data and needs maintenance.
        last_error_time (google.protobuf.timestamp_pb2.Timestamp):
            [Output only] The time the most recent error occurred, such
            as a failure to publish to Cloud Pub/Sub. This field is the
            timestamp of 'last_error_status'.
        last_error_status (google.rpc.status_pb2.Status):
            [Output only] The error message of the most recent error,
            such as a failure to publish to Cloud Pub/Sub.
            'last_error_time' is the timestamp of this field. If no
            errors have occurred, this field has an empty message and
            the status code 0 == OK. Otherwise, this field is expected
            to have a status code other than OK.

            The most recent device configuration, which is eventually
            sent from Cloud IoT Core to the device. If not present on
            creation, the configuration will be initialized with an
            empty payload and version value of ``1``. To update this
            field after creation, use the
            ``DeviceManager.ModifyCloudToDeviceConfig`` method.
        state (google.cloud.iot_v1.types.DeviceState):

            present.

            metadata is not interpreted or indexed by Cloud IoT Core. It
            can be used to add contextual information for the device.

            Values are free-form strings. Each value must be less than
