                ``binding`` binds one or more ``members`` to a single
                ``role``. Members can be user accounts, service
                accounts, Google groups, and domains (such as G Suite).
                A ``role`` is a named list of permissions (defined by
                IAM or configured by users). A ``binding`` can
                optionally specify a ``condition``, which is a logic
                expression that further constrains the role binding
                based on attributes about the request and/or target
                resource.

                Platform resources.

                A ``Policy`` is a collection of ``bindings``. A
                ``binding`` binds one or more ``members`` to a single
                ``role``. Members can be user accounts, service
                accounts, Google groups, and domains (such as G Suite).
                A ``role`` is a named list of permissions (defined by
                IAM or configured by users). A ``binding`` can
                optionally specify a ``condition``, which is a logic
                expression that further constrains the role binding
                based on attributes about the request and/or target
                resource.
